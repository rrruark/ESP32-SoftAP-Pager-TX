# ESP32-SoftAP-Pager-TX
Allows pages to be sent through a web browser.

<p>This will run on a Heltec Wifi LoRa 32(V3). The user connects to the access point and is able to send pages through the web interface. Pages are POCSAG at 1200 bps but can be reconfigured to anything supported by Radiolib. Tested and working on hardware, but it could use some improvement in input checking for ruggedness.</p>
